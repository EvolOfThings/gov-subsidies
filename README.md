# Government Subsidies

This is built on [Anon Aadhaar](https://github.com/anon-aadhaar/anon-aadhaar).

Anon Aadhaar is a zero-knowledge protocol designed to enable Aadhaar citizens to prove their possession of an Aadhaar document issued and signed by the government. This process ensures anonymity by utilizing the Aadhaar secure QR code, presents on e-Aadhaar and Aadhaar print-letter, preserving the confidentiality of the Aadhaar number.

This project shows how Indian nationals can check the government subsidies available to them through ZK verified proofs. The user can verify his/her Indian nationality without disclosing the Aadhaar number.
